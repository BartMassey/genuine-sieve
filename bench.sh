# Run all the implementations, reporting timing.

# I was using a non-standard version of the "time" command I
# rewrote to get extra precision.  I plan to upstream
# it. Now that I've ironed out timing loop lengths, it
# should actually be adequate to use standard time in the
# meantime.

#TIME="etime -f %3e"
TIME="time -f %e"

# Note: "2>&1 >/dev/null" sends the time output that was on
# stderr to stdout and throws away the result "0" that the
# program prints on stdout.
